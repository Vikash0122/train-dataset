# Description

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a directive requiring manufacturers and fleet operators to report certain crashes involving either advanced driver assistance or higher-level “automated driving systems.” The files describe each report and include information about the car, location, circumstances, and injury level.

# Details

The General Order allows NHTSA to obtain timely and transparent notification of real-world crashes associated with ADS and Level 2 ADAS vehicles from manufacturers and operators. With these data, NHTSA can respond to crashes that raise safety concerns about ADS and Level 2 ADAS technologies through further investigation and enforcement. If NHTSA finds a safety defect, it will take action to ensure that unsafe vehicles are taken off public roads or remedied, as appropriate.
NHTSA issued the General Order in June 2021 to evaluate whether the manufacturers of ADS and Level 2 ADAS systems and the vehicles equipped with them, including manufacturers of prototype vehicles and equipment, are meeting their statutory obligations to ensure that their vehicles and equipment are free of defects that pose unreasonable risks to motor vehicle safety. Prior to the implementation of the General Order, NHTSA’s sources of timely crash notifications were limited and generally inconsistent across manufacturers, including developers.
